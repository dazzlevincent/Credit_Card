### Plan:

1. **Modify `simple_test.py`**:
   - Update the label encoding logic to check for new categories in the categorical columns (`merchant`, `category`, `gender`, `job`).
   - Assign default labels for any new categories detected during the prediction process.

2. **Update `save_encoders.py`**:
   - Ensure that the label encoders can handle new categories by fitting them on the complete dataset.
   - Implement logic to assign default labels for any unseen categories when encoding.

3. **Revise `interface.py`**:
   - Confirm that the fraud detection function correctly handles new categories and assigns default labels.
   - Ensure that the prediction results are clearly communicated to the user.

4. **Adjust `three_models.py`**:
   - Update the encoding logic to handle new categories during model training.
   - Ensure that the models are trained with the correct handling of new categories.

### Follow-up Steps:
- After implementing the changes, test the application to ensure that it correctly handles new categories and provides accurate predictions.
- Verify that the user interface reflects any changes made to the prediction logic.
